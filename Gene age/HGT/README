P. bursaria horizontal gene transfer (HGT) genes were identified by two steps, similar to the strategy widely used.106-108 Firstly, the potential genes were screened by using RBH BLASTP (Reciprocal best hit) against the Chlorella variabilis genes with a high cut-off, i.e., 1e-10 e-value and 30% identity. This step acquired 871 candidates. Secondly, the candidates were BLASTP searched (1e-10) against both genus Paramecium and genus Chlorella in the protein database (NCBI Reference Sequence Database, RefSeq). The retrieved homologs and candidates were aligned by MUSCLE102 and phylogenetic trees were constructed by FastTree.103 Under manual scrutiny, a gene clustered in the Chlorella clade which had a Paramecium outgroup was accepted as an HGT-like gene (159 such genes were recovered).
